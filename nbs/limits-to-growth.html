 # Limits To Growth

 As I discussed in my <a href="anthology.html">recent post</a>, my world view has changed a lot in the last several years.  One of the most impactful books was [Limits To Growth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Limits_to_Growth), a book from 1972 that tried to simulate the earth over the next century or so and came away with a rather pessimistic view of the near future.  This model [World3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World3) was a large set of coupled differential equations.

 # Notes

 Looks like the latest models is World3-03. And there is an [arXiv paper](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.07634v1) that specifically looks at adding AI as new variables.

 Things I want to do, basically, I'd like to implement the model myself, and
 try to build a version with uncertainty.  I'd also like to do Mark Transtrum's
 stuff, finding out if its sloppy and what the driving things are, look for
 some kind of simplification.
