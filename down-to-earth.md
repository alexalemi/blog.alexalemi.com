Today my son asked me a simple question:

<blockquote>
If you dropped a feather from the moon, how long would it take to land on the earth?
</blockquote>

I tried to answer the question and discovered that the question was a bit more subtle than I initially thought it would be.  It also made me think more about science education and how we teach students to solve problems.

Overall, I feel as though science education is too formulaic and rigid. My experience as a physics TA showed me that even at ivy league schools, students have a tendency to put their science and math education in the *upside-down*<a href="#upside-down"><sup>xxa-ud</sup></a>.

## Falling Feather


## Einstein's Letter

<blockquote style='font-family: "Lucida Handwriting", "Brush Script MT", cursive;'>
Dear Sir,

I am a highschool student and have a problem.

My teacher and I were talking about Satan. Of course you know that when he fell from heaven,
he fell for nine days, and nine nights, at 32 feet a second and was increasing his speed every second.

I was told there was a foluma [sic] to it. I know you don't have time for such little things,
but if possible please send me the foluma.

Thank you,
Jerry
