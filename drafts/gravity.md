One day I sat in a physics colloquium that has stuck with me.  I honestly don't remember
too many of the details of the talk, but I remember the opening sequence of slides.  The speaker 
(I'm afraid I don't remember whom) was from the [WMAP project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilkinson_Microwave_Anisotropy_Probe) whose mission was to map the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation (CMB).

Normally, the WMAP results, the ones you see in the press look like this:

But this is the CMB <i>anomaly</i>, its the fluctuations in the CMB that are left if we 
remove all of the parts we know about!
