There are corners of the internet where people argue whether [Seximal](https://www.seximal.net/), [Dozenal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duodecimal) or [decimal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal) are the best way to represent numbers<a href="#others"><sup>1</sup></a>.

I find myself quite sympathetic to the arguments in favor of seximal.  Base six
is a nice small base, with a lot of factors and would simplify most arithmetic
we do on a daily basis.  However, if I'm being honest, most of the arithmetic I
do on a daily basis is done with numbers in scientific notation.

[Scientific notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_notation) is nice because it aligns well with our naturally logarithmic sense of numbers.<sup><a href="#natural-log">2</a></sup>. A number is simplified down to its <i class="em1">significand</i> and <i class="em2">exponent</i>, just like in [floating point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_arithmetic).  For example the number 299,792,458<sup><a href="#speed-of-light">3</a></sup> would become:

$$ \color{steelblue}{2.99792458} \times 10^{\color{salmon} 8} $$

Now the focus has shifted, we can look to the exponent to the right to immediately figure out the <i>scale</i>
of the number, and the significand only has the sort of <i>numberness</i> of the number, and we can see that this
particular number is very three-like.
