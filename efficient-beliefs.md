[Newtonian Mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Newtonian_mechanics) and [Lagrangian Mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_mechanics) are two different formulations of [Mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics); they both give all of the same answers, but they describe the world in very different ways.

In Newtonian Mechanics, the universe is clockwork.
Newtonian Mechanics is a set of rules that given the *state* of the world, given a complete description of what is happening, you can turn the crank to determine the next state of the world.
By turning the crank you can calculate the exact path through configuration space a system will follow.  You can determine the path of a trajectory one step at a time.

In Lagrangian mechanics, the story is quite different.  Instead of turning a crank to deliver the one true path, you consider *all possible paths*.  You consider the space of all possible trajectories your system could follow and use some *action* some guiding principle or an objective to *score* these possible paths and determine which amongst them is best.
