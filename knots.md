Years ago I decided that I didn't know how to tie any knots and needed to remidy the situation.  Unfortunately if you start to look into knots you discover there is a whole slew of them.  Its easy to dive deep and try out dozens of different knots and then be left not remembering how to tie any of them.  So, I decided I was going to try to pick the best knot for each of a few different scenarios and then focus on learning and retaining those knots well.

I can say that having done this nearly a decade ago, its paid off.  Its not the kind of thing that comes up very often, but when it does, knowing what to do with a rope has proven a very useful skill.  So, which knots do I recommend.
