A friend recently introduced me to
[Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/) which is a simple daily word
puzzle game. It is essentially a word game version of
[Mastermind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)) the old
code-breaking game.  As a word game, it is also similar to it's harder cousin
[Jotto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jotto).  It was created by [Josh
Wardle](https://twitter.com/powerlanguish) (hence Wordle) also known for
creating [The Button](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Button_(Reddit)) on
[reddit](https://reddit.com).

Each day, there is a secret, five-letter English word.  You must guess a
five-letter English word.  At that point you are told if any of your letters
are the correct letter in the correct spot, if so, it will be green.  A correct
letter in the wrong spot will be yellow, and a letter that doesn't appear will
be grey.  Using this information you can refine your guesses and if you are
good, you'll determine the correct word in the alloted 6 rounds.

The game has become [quite](https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/jan/11/wordle-creator-overwhelmed-by-global-success-of-hit-puzzle)
