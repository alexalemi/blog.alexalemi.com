      <h1>Knots</h1><h1>

    </h1></header>
    <div class="content">
    <p>Years ago I decided that I didn't know how to tie any knots and needed to
remedy the situation.  Unfortunately, if you start to look into knots you
discover there is a whole slew of them.  It's easy to dive deep and try out
dozens of different knots and then be left not remembering how to tie any of
them.  So, I decided I was going to try to pick the best knot for each of a few
different scenarios and then focus on learning and retaining those knots well.</p>
<p>I can say that having done this nearly a decade ago, it's paid off.  It's not the
kind of thing that comes up very often, but when it does, knowing what to do
with a rope has proven a very useful skill.  So, which knots do I recommend?</p>
<p>Most sources of this type tend to focus on specific jobs or activities, the
best boating knots, or scouting knots, climbing knots, etc.  I don't do any of
those things.  Instead I want to know how to not embarrass myself if I find
myself needing to accomplish some kind of task with a rope.  So, for each of
the common use cases for a rope, I've tried to identify the "best" knot to use.
Best, in this case means some combination of ease of tying, ease of remembering
and strength and ability of the knot. A lot of knots will have "false friends"
of a sort, very closely related knots that are often much worse in their
characteristics.  I tried to pay special attention here, as I don't very often
use knots so I need to ensure the ones I focus on learning are robust in the
sense that even if I haven't tied it for a few years I'm unlikely to make a
grave mistake.</p>
<h2>Tie off</h2>
<p>If I'm being honest, the most common knot I tie, nearly every day is the
<a href="https://www.animatedknots.com/square-knot">Square knot</a>, also known as the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reef_knot">reef knot</a>.  This is because its the
knot I use to tie my shoes, or tie off garbage bags, that sort of thing.</p>

<p>The knot is very common and nearly everyone knows it, but one thing I've
discovered is that a good fraction of people actually tie the knot incorrectly!
By far, the most useful thing I learned all those years ago when I decided to
dive into knots was that I had been tying my shoes wrong my entire life.</p>
<p>To tie a proper reef knot, you have to alternate which rope goes on top.  The
mnemonic is <em>right over left, then left over right</em>, if you instead do <em>right
over right then right over right</em> as I did most of my life, you end up with the
far worse knot the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granny_knot">Granny Knot</a>
instead.</p>
<p>Throughout my childhood and young adult life it always seemed as though my
shoelaces would come untied, I often had to revert to double knotting them to
try to get them to last the whole day.  The problem the entire time was that I
was tying the wrong knot.  I've since caught out many of the friends and family
having the exact same problem.  If you spend a few minutes tying both a proper
square knot and a granny knot you can immediately learn to tell the difference.
The tell tale sign when looking at someone's shoes are to check to see if the
loops are <em>crooked</em>.  Proper shoelace loops should lie down the sides of the
shoe.  If a granny knot is tied, they tend to rotate and lie parallel to the
shoe but perpendicular to the laces.  For more info, see <a href="https://www.fieggen.com/shoelace/grannyknot.htm">Ian Fieggen's
site</a>.</p>
<p>Now, as I said, the square knot is by far the most common knot I tie, which is a bit unfortunate because the knot itself is pretty poor. It should not be used in any sort of critical situation.  Aside from tying off garbage bags and shoelaces it shouldn't be used at all.  <em>It should never be used to join two ropes</em>. Ashley<sup><a href="#ashley">1</a></sup> claimed that reef knots have caused more deaths than all other knots combined.  Given their familiarity I imagine many people use them to join ropes not realizing their tendency to slip until its too late.  Learn how to tie a square knot properly but also learn alternatives to use for basically all use cases.</p>
<aside> <sup id="ashley">1</sup> 
  Ashley of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ashley_Book_of_Knots"><i>The Ashley Book of Knots</i></a>, a truly remarkable book.  Published in 1944 it remains the goto reference on knots. Ashley spent 11 years compiling over 3800 numbered entries and 7000 of his own illustrations.  It's an extremely impressive bit of scholarship.

<h3>Shoelaces</h3>
<p>Speaking of Ian Fieggen, I actually use his <a href="https://www.animatedknots.com/shoelace-bow-knot-fieggen-method">quick method</a>
to try my shoes these days.
It only takes a few minutes to learn and then you can use it the rest of your life, I recommend checking it out.</p>

<h2>Loop at end of rope</h2>
<p>The next most common use case I find myself in is wanting to tie a loop at the
end of a rope.  For this I think the
<a href="https://www.animatedknots.com/bowline-knot">Bowline</a> is the goto answer.</p>

<p>The Bowline is often described as the "king of knots".  It's a nice knot to
know.  The loop formed doesn't collapse, so can be used to make a handle, to
tie a rope around a hole, pole or other object.  If you make a Bowline in the
end and then pass the rest of the rope through you can make a type of lasso.
Even after used the knot is usually easy to untie.</p>
<p>Tying the knot is simple and easy to remember, especially with the common
mnemonic: <em>"The rabbit comes up the hole, runs around the tree then back down
the hole."</em></p>

<h2>Binding</h2>

<h2>Stopper Knot</h2>
<p>The first use case for a knot is as a simple stopper knot.  Sometimes we just need to put a bit of bulk into the end of a rope to keep it from slipping through something else.</p>
